        "## How to Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Option 1: Quick Run (Recommended)\n",
        "1. Run **Cell 1** - Install packages\n",
        "2. Run **Cell 2** - Setup and configure APIs\n",
        "3. Run **Cell 11 (Last Cell)** - This will execute the entire pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "### Option 2: Step by Step\n",
        "Run cells in order (1-11) to see detailed output at each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What the Pipeline Does:\n",
        "1. ✓ Uploads your resume PDF\n",
        "2. ✓ Parses PDF and extracts text\n",
        "3. ✓ Generates metadata (file hash, timestamps)\n",
        "4. ✓ Sends to Gemini API for structured parsing\n",
        "5. ✓ Builds embedding text (skills, experience, projects)\n",
        "6. ✓ Generates vector embeddings using BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5\n",
        "7. ✓ Exports results to JSON file\n",
        "\n",
        "## Output:\n",
        "- Extracted resume data (JSON)\n",
        "- Vector embeddings\n",
        "- File saved to: `./resumes/{file_hash}.json`"
